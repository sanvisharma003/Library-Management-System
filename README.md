# Library-Management-System

This C++ code represents a simple console-based library management system. The program utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to manage books, customers, and administrative functionalities.

The program begins with user registration, where customers provide their details, including name, email, username, and password, stored in a file named "cust pass.txt." The system supports two user roles: administrator and customer. Administrators can add, update, delete, search, and display books in the library. The book details, such as ID, name, author, price, and quantity, are managed through classes and stored in an array.

Customers can view all books, search for a specific book by ID, author, or name, and purchase books, reducing the available quantity. The purchasing process involves entering the book's ID, displaying the details, updating the quantity, and confirming the purchase.

The program has a simple login mechanism for both administrators and customers, and user interactions are organized through various menus. The main function serves as the entry point, presenting registration, login, and exit options. The system provides a basic but functional framework for a library management system, demonstrating file handling, user authentication, and OOP concepts in C++.
